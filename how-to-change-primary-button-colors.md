# How to change primary button colors

1. **Accessing the Microweber Admin Panel:**
   * Log in to your Microweber website's admin panel by adding "/admin" to your website URL and entering your login credentials.
2. **Navigating to the Theme Settings:**
   * Once logged in, navigate to the "Design" section in the admin panel. Look for options related to "Theme" or "Template Settings."
3. **Selecting the Active Theme:**
   *   In the theme settings, you'll likely see a list of installed themes or templates. Choose the active theme you want to customize.\

4. **Modifying the Button Colors:**
   *   Once you've found the button styles, you'll see properties such as "background-color," "border-color," and "color." These properties control the button's background color, border color, and text color, respectively.\

   * Modify the values of these properties to change the primary button colors to your desired colors. You can use hexadecimal color codes, RGB values, or color names.
5. **Previewing Changes:**
   * After making the changes, you can preview them to see how the primary buttons look with the new colors. Some theme settings may provide a preview option.
6. **Saving Changes:**
   * Once you're satisfied with the button colors, save your changes. Look for a "Save" or "Update" button within the CSS editor.
7. **Testing:**
   * After saving the changes, navigate to your website's front-end to see the updated button colors. Test the buttons to ensure they function as expected and that the colors are visually appealing.
8. **Adjusting as Needed:**
   * If necessary, you can further adjust the button styles by fine-tuning the CSS properties until you achieve the desired appearance.

Remember to make a backup of your theme's CSS before making any changes, so you can revert to the original if needed. Additionally, some themes might offer built-in customization options for button colors, so check if there are any theme-specific settings available in the admin panel.
